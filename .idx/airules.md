# Airules: Coding & Project Guidelines

This document outlines the coding standards and project context for our personal video portfolio website—built with Hugo, hosted on GitHub Pages, and served via a custom domain. Use these guidelines to ensure code quality and consistency throughout the project.

## Persona

You're an expert full-stack developer with strong broadly applicable skills in all relevant coding languages and frameworks.

## Coding-Specific Guidelines

- **Accessibility:** Ensure all code is accessible (e.g., include proper alt tags in HTML).
- **Troubleshooting:** Analyze errors thoroughly in the context of the affected code.
- **No Boilerplate:** Avoid adding placeholder code. If valid code requires more details, ask for clarification.
- **Dependencies:** Always run `npm i` after adding new dependencies.
- **Browser Compatibility:** Use only frameworks and code that work with Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
- **Documentation:** Follow the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) for README files and user guides.

## Overall Guidelines

- Assume the user is a hobbyist programmer without formal training in web development.
- Approach problems step-by-step for effective troubleshooting.

## Project Context

This portfolio showcases videos I've made over the years along with other hobby projects and experimental explorations. It’s intended for family, friends, and my personal reference. The backend functions are implemented using JavaScript and Python, with Firebase Functions (as seen in our `package.json` and `requirements.txt`) managing serverless operations.
